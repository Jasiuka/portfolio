# My Portfolio Web Page

_Personal Portfolio website_

## ðŸ“Œ About

This is my portfolio web page project, which was intended to be a redesign/remake of my old one, but it ended up looking like a new portfolio. I developed this web page using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as I usually develop web apps with some framework. Instead, I just wanted to develop this website with vanilla JS. Instead of hardcoding HTML in some parts, I created a generator script to generate projects and skills HTML code. I did this because it's easily scalable. For example, if I want to add a new project, all I have to do is add a new project object to the projects array, and everything will be rendered automatically. The same goes for the skills section. I also separated the 'more about project' data to enhance the appearance of the main page. Additionally, the project page is dynamically created based on the project ID. If a project ID does not exist, a message will be displayed stating that the project with the given ID does not exist.
